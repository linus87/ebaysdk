# ebaysdkcore
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/linus87/ebaysdkcore.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/linus87/ebaysdkcore)

`ebaysdkcore`, also known as the "eBay SDK for Java" provides convenient access to the eBay Trading API. It contains code generated from the Trading API WSDL and a thin wrapper which simplify common tasks like providing credentials or setting commonly used parameters.

This project aims to provide a reliable build of the official eBay source code releases for the eBay SDK for Java, conventiently distributed via the Maven Central Repository, with minimal differences to the binaries found in the official eBay downloads.

# versioning
Major versions are maintained in a one to one correspondance with the versions of releases made available on the eBay Developer Program website. For example, version `981.0.0` of this project would be a build of Version 981 of the eBay release. Subsequent minor or patch versions of this projects (`981.0.1`, `981.1.0` etc) represent builds from the same eBay source code. eBay maintains a one to one correspondence between versions of the SDK and versions of the Trading API.

# monkey patches
A small number of changes are maintained in order to make the artifacts more suitable for distribution via Maven:
 - Declared compile dependencies on `log4j:log4fj` and `commons-logging:commons-logging` have been removed to allow users of this project to select their own logging implementation, as the eBay source code uses `org.slf4j:slf4j-api` exculsively.
 - JAX-WS Code generation from the WSDL is done with a Maven plugin (`jaxws-maven-plugin`) instead of running the Ant task `com.sun.tools.ws.ant.WsImport` via the Maven plugin `maven-antrun-plugin`. This is to prevent hard coded file system paths for `wsdlLocation` ending up in the generated source code (see [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9802487/controlling-jax-ws-wsdllocation-attribute-values-absolute-path-with-jaxws-mav))
 - The provided WSDL `eBaySvc.wsdl` is packaged inside eBay's namespace `com.ebay.sdk` instead of at the root of the classpath. If you need to load the WSDL from the classpath, you can use `"com/ebay/sdk/eBaySvc.wsdl"` instead of `"eBaySvc.wsdl"` as the path.
